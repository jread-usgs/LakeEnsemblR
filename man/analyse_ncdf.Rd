\usage{
analyse_ncdf(
  ncdf,
  model,
  dim = "model",
  dim_index = 1,
  spin_up = 0,
  drho = 0.1
)

analyze_ncdf(
  ncdf,
  model,
  dim = "model",
  dim_index = 1,
  spin_up = 0,
  drho = 0.1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ncdf}{filepath; to the `ensemble_output.nc` file}

\item{model}{Vector of models for which to calculate the performance measures}

\item{dim}{character; NetCDF dimensions to extract. Must be either "member" or "model". Defaults to "model". Only used if plotting from netCDF file. Currently only works with "model".}

\item{dim_index}{numeric; Index of dimension chosen to extract from. Defaults to 1. Only used if plotting from netCDF file.}

\item{spin_up}{numeric; Number of days to disregard as spin-up for analysis.}

\item{drho}{numeric; density difference between top and bottom indicating stratification
[kg m^-3]}
}
\value{
list of four dataframes: 'out_df' = long data frame with date, depths, temp and model,
'stats' = summary statistics of model fitness compared to observed and mean differences between modelled and observed phenological events,
'strat' = stratification statistics for each year,
'obs_temp' = long dataframe of observed data within the netCDF file
